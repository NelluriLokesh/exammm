The idea of evolution (which is gradual change) was not a new one. The Greeks had thought of it, so had Erasmus Darwin, the grand father of Charles Darwin, and also the Frenchman, Lamarck. It is one thing to have an idea, we can all guess and sometimes make a lucky guess. It is quite another thing to produce a proof of the correctness of that idea. Darwin thought he had that proof in his notebooks. He saw that all animals had to struggle to survive. Those which were best at surviving their environment passed on the good qualities which helped them to their descendants. This was called 'the survival of the fittest'. For example, in a cold climate, those who have the warmest fur will live. Darwin believed that this necessity for an animal to deal with its environment explained the immense variety of creatures.

Different forms of life at different levels of existence make up the teeming denizens of this earth of ours, And, no matter whether they belong to the higher groups such as human beings or to the lower groups such as animals, all beings primarily seek peace, comfort and security.

To those who do listen, the desert speaks of things with an emphasis quite different from that of the shore, the mountain, the valley or the plains. Whereas these invite action and suggest limitless opportunity and exhaust less resources, the implications and the mood of the desert are something different. For one thing, the desert is conservative and not radical. It is more likely to provide awe than to invite conquest. The heroism which it encourages is the heroism of endurance, not that of conquest. It brings man up against this limitation, turns him upon himself and suggests values which more indulgent regions suppress. Sometimes it includes contemplation in men who have never contemplated before. And of all the answers to the question- what is a desert good for - 'contemplation' is perhaps the best.

 Conservative in his responses
 Courageous in his reaction
 A good listener
 Sensitive to nature

 Indolence
 Contemplation
 Adventurous spirit

3. If one responds with insight to the mood of the desert, it evokes—

 An inclination for deep thought
 The desire for heroic conquest
 A sense of intense revulsion
 The possibility of unending resources

ans : An inclination for deep thought


4. The writer calls the desert ‘conservative’ rather than ‘radical’ because it provides an environment that—

 Offers unlimited opportunity to conquer
 Inspires man to explore it
 Makes one gloomy
 Tests one’s endurance

ans : Tests one’s endurance


5. What does the phrase “it brings man up against his limitations”, mean ?
